			More than 14 days of inactivity might result in a kick, but we will guarantee you can keep your spot during that time. There are a couple exceptions to this:
			:white_small_square: We know that long periods of content-deprivation (e.g. no updates for more than a month) tend to happen with Warframe and will usually take that into account.
			:white_small_square: Let the moderators know if you’d like to be absent for a longer period of time.
			:white_small_square: We consider 60 days to be our hard limit. Reaching this limit will almost surely result in a kick.
			:white_small_square: We might kick players below 14 days of inactivity if we suspect they’re just logging in for the sake of reserving their own spot without actually playing.
			:white_small_square: At any given time we might be condoning activity checks on our Discord server. We expect a fitting response to these.`
